Firmware Versions
=================
* 0.0.1 - 07 Jun 2022
  - Initial version with support for GPIOs, I2C and UART.
* 0.0.2 - 11 Aug 2022
  - Fixed evaluation and assignment of I2C master ports.
* 0.0.3 - 08 Sep 2022
  - Inverted the polarity of the I2C reset signals. 
* 0.0.4 - 16 Sep 2022
  - Added QSSI support in the firmware for access to the IS25LP064A-JBLA3
    64 Mbit SPI and quad SPI flash memory device.
* 0.0.4 - 20 Sep 2022
  - Updated the QSSI functions for better flexibility.
* 0.0.5 - 06 Oct 2022
  - Fixed the power down sequence for the FPGA power.
* 0.0.6 - 11 Oct 2022
  - Changed the type of the GPIO PF0 (pin 42) from open drain to output, so
    that it can drive a high level on the net FPGA_PROG_B against the pulldown
    resistor R180. This is requrired to download the FPGA firmware.
* 0.0.7 - 11 Oct 2022
  - Changed the type of the GPIO PF1 (pin 43) from open drain to input, as the
    level converter IC21 is configured to only drive the FPGA_INIT_B signal
    from the FPGA to the MCU.
* 0.0.8 - 24 Feb 2023
  - Implemented changes made by Pro Design after finishing the type testing of
    the CM prototype V1.
